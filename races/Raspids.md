> The Raspids are a plantoid-fungoid race encountered on the anti-spinward frontier of the Celestial Mandate of Telanas. Adult forms appear to be several metres tall, with a variety of growths and appendages covering a central trunk, and rusty red in colour. Not much is known about them as their core worlds have yet to be encountered; they employ biotechnology and much of their technology is 'grown' rather than assembled. 

> Their ships and stations have been hostile to the Telanians since first contact, though some suggest the Raspids are simply trying to enforce a perimiter around their living space.
