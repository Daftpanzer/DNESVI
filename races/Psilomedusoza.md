> The Psilomedusoza are one of the more advanced and 'enigmatic' of the new generation, and the evolution of their society and technology is believed to have taken many tens of thousands of years. 

> Physcially they exhibit a huge amount of variance in the morphology of their appedages and body shape, but are essentially filter-feeders that grow in cojoined colonies. Colonies reproduce via free-swiming larvae which settle on the seafloor during development, until they mature as sub-adults that instictively seek to join existing colonies or combine with other sub-adults to form new ones.

> As individuals they have only an animal level of intelligence. Sentience emergeces through cojoined nervous systems of many individuals, it is colonies that one will converse with. Starships will contain at least a small colony living in the confined quarters of a nutrient bath. Cybernetic interfaces allow the colony to 'become one' with their vessels and experience outside space as if through their own senses.
